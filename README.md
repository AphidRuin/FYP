This is a series of CSV and Jupyter notebooks containing codes on my investigations in phase chirp effects due to an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) in a typical optical clock setup.

All readings were made in lab and conditions were controlled for as much as possible.

There are two parts to the investigation - the relationship between driving frequency of the AOM and the change in frequency observed, as well as the type of pulse interrogation used (Rabi, Ramsey, Hyper-Ramsey).

The first part is experimental (linear regression with lab data) while the second part is theoretical (re-doing calculations by referencing past literature and performing new analytical calculations/approximations for Hyper-Ramsey).

*Omitted CSV files that were too huge (>25 MB) - 1 minute of background data as noise for benchmarking.
